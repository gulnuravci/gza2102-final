        <p>My favorite class I've taken so far has been physics. I like the 
        professor and the structure of the class. There has been continuity in
        the content since I took <i>Physics I</i> last semester and <i>Physics II</i>
        this semester. Since I have mostly been completing requirements so far, 
        I am pretty satisfied with the rest of my STEM classes.</p>
